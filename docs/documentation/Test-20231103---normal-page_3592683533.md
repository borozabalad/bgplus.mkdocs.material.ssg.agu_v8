# Preface

------------------------------------------------------------------------

**<span colorid="888nq4jo4y">p. 8</span>**

Graph theory is the oldest and <span colorid="kshmplh16k">most geometric
branch of topology</span>, making it a natural supplement to either a
geometry or topology course.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Sets

------------------------------------------------------------------------

**<span colorid="d9wxtb4mzn">p. 21</span>**

***Definition 1.*** A *set* is a collection of distinct objects, none of
which is the set itself.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

**<span colorid="z15lf3jed0">p. 23</span>**

***Definition 2.*** A set containing no elements is called a *null set*
or an *empty set.*

***Definition 3.*** A set *A* is said to be a subset of a set *B*,
denoted “*A ⊂ B*”, if every element of *A* is also an element of *B*.

***Convention.*** We agree to consider an empty set to be a subset of
every set.

***Definition 4.*** A set *A* is said to be equal to a set *B*, denoted
“*A = B*”, if *A ⊂ B* and *B ⊂ A.*

***Theorem 1.** There is only one empty set.*

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Graphs

**<span colorid="9ym0at11zl">p. ç29</span>**

***Definition 5.*** A graph is an object consisting of two sets called
its vertex set and its edge set. The vertex set is a finite nonempty
set. The edge set may be empty, but otherwise its elements are
two-element subsets of the vertex set.

***Definition 6.*** The elements of the vertex set of a graph are called
vertices (singular: vertex) and the elements of the edge set are called
edges. We shall denote the number of vertices by “v” and the number of
edges by “e”.

***Definition 7.*** If {X, Y} is an edge of a graph, we say that {X, Y}
joins or connects the vertices X and Y, and that X and Y are adjacent to
one another. The edge {X, Y} is incident to each of X and Y, and each of
X and Y is incident to {X, Y}. Two edges incident to the same vertex are
called adjacent edges. A vertex incident to no edges at all is isolated.

**<span colorid="m95inoj09e">p. 31</span>**

***Definition 8.*** We will say that two graphs are equal if they have
equal vertex sets and equal edge sets. And we will say that two graph
diagrams are equal if they represent equal vertex sets and equal edge
sets.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Cautions

**<span colorid="g2b6u15yta">p. 35</span>**

6\) The definition of graph precludes “loops” (vertices joined to
themselves) and “skeins” (several edges joining the same pair of
vertices). This is because a loop would translate abstractly as an
“edge” of the form {A, A}, which is impossible as {A, A} is not a set
(see p. 14 and Definition 5); and a skein would imply the multiple
inclusion of an element {A, B} in the edge collection, which would
prevent the collection of edges from being a set as required. Were we to
allow skeins but not loops we would have something called a
“multigraph”; the result of allowing both is called a “pseudograph”. We
will discuss multigraphs in Chapter 8, but we will not discuss
pseudographs.

7\) The edges of a graph are undirected; that is, any impression that
the notation {A, B} may give of an edge “going from A toward B” is
unintentional. Remember that {A, B} = {B, A}. A graph-like thing in
which the edges have direction is called a “digraph”. We will not
discuss digraphs in this book. See Figure 11.

## Complements and subgraphs

------------------------------------------------------------------------

**<span colorid="2b9eyzt7ml">p. 42 </span>**

***Definition 13.*** If G is a graph then the complement of G, denoted
“G”, is a graph having the same vertex set; the edge set of Ḡ consists
of all two-element subsets of the vertex set which have not already been
included in the edge set of Ḡ.

Thus Ḡ has the same vertices as G but the edges are in the “opposite”
places. If two vertices are connected in G, they are not connected in Ḡ;
and if two vertices are not connected in G, then they are connected in Ḡ.
